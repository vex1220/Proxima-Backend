// NOTIFICATION TYPES
// =============================================================================

// Every notification flows through these types, making it easy to add new
// notification types without touching existing code.

/**
 * Every notification has a "type" string. This enum defines all known types.
 * When you add a new notification trigger, add a new entry here first.
 *
 * WHY A CONST OBJECT INSTEAD OF A TS ENUM?
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * TypeScript enums compile to reverse-mapped objects, which can cause
 * surprising runtime behavior. A `const` object with `as const` gives you
 * the same type safety with simpler JS output.

 * signature: (ctx: NotificationContext) => NotificationPayload | null.
 * This uniformity is what makes the rule engine scalable — you register
 * a function, the engine calls it, done. No adapter pattern needed.
